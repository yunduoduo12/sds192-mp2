## Load the data set we'll work on
```{r}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

## Make sure that the row and column counts match!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(house_elections)
glimpse(candidates)
glimpse(committees)
glimpse(contributions)
```


```{r, warning=FALSE}
#we first join the  data of contributiions and candidates by the "candidate id"
joined <- candidates %>%
  full_join(contributions, by = "cand_id")
##We chose only candidates who are seeking their state senate seats in the years between 2010 and 2016 using the verb "filter". We also use select to have only the variables that we need. 
Sjoined <- joined %>%
  filter(cand_election_yr >= 2010 & cand_office == "S") %>%
  select(cand_id, cand_party_affiliation, cand_election_yr, cand_ici, cand_state, transaction_amt) ##%>%
  
##we want to replace all the na with the 0
Sjoined[is.na(Sjoined)] <- 0

summary2 <- Sjoined %>%
  group_by(cand_party_affiliation) %>%
  summarize(amount = sum(transaction_amt))  #This codes will show us the amount each party received.

##From above, we are going to get rid of all the party that received $0.00 contributions in the six years. We then  look how much each party received in the year. This data can be used to see if there exists a relationship between the amount received and the number of seats won.
zz <- Sjoined %>%
  group_by(cand_election_yr)  %>%
  summarize(amount = sum(transaction_amt),
            dem = sum(ifelse (cand_party_affiliation == "DEM", transaction_amt, 0)),
            rep = sum(ifelse (cand_party_affiliation == "REP", transaction_amt, 0)),
            lib = sum(ifelse (cand_party_affiliation == "LIB", transaction_amt, 0)),
            dfl = sum(ifelse (cand_party_affiliation == "DFL", transaction_amt, 0)),
            gre = sum(ifelse (cand_party_affiliation == "GRE", transaction_amt, 0)),
